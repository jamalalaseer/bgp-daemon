- allow for interactive interface (with perl eval?)
- incorporate newest revision of BGP RFC
- optimize and finish route selection for local-RIB
- add proper support for MP extensions
- add support for BGP/MPLS VPNs
- add support for IPv6

- have a go at adding the FSM and adjRIB-out??? dunno yet. There is little
  point in doing it but it could be fun.
