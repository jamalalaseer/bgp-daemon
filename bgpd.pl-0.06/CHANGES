RELEASE bgpd.pl-0.06 released on October 1st 2002
- Fixes provided by Andrew of Supernews <andrew@supernews.net> for the 
route selection algorithm used to select for a route announced by two or
more peers.
  
RELEASE bgpd.pl-0.05 released on June 20th 2002
- Fixes provided Andrew of Supernews <andrew@supernews.net> His coments
included below:
--------------------
 - (critical) the logic of BGP::Neighbor::receive was completely wrong,
   leading to failure of the session (and many perl warnings) any time
   that the data returned from sysread() was shorter than expected,
   which is something that TCP-based applications must _always_ expect
   and handle.
 - (annoying) router-id in the config file didn't work at all
 - (serious) updates where the AS-PATH was present but empty (which is
   normal for local routes from iBGP peers) were treated as though
   the AS-PATH were missing (killing the session)
 - (trivial) changed the dump output format to eliminate whitespace in
   the prefix output for prefixes smaller than /10
 - (performance) most of the time taken to take in a full routing table
   was being eaten by BGP::Neighbor::log due to doing significant
   processing before checking the log level. The change I did results in
   about a 2x speedup with most logging turned off
I also changed the logfile open to use append mode, not really a bug
but probably more useful in most cases.

Stuff I didn't fix: your daemonize function uses a method that would
have been archaic 10 years ago, and closing stdin/out/err without
reopening them again is a dangerous practice. Check out
POSIX::setsid. (I'm not currently using daemon mode for various
reasons)

RELEASE bgpd.pl-0.04 released on December 9th 2001
- fixed bug in AdjRibIn.pm where `!=' was used to compare packed IP addresses.
- fixed bug Neighbor.pm where UPDATES with unfeasable routes would not
  have their new routes processed
- fixed bug Neighbor.pm where the closure of a BGP session would not
  undefine the filehandle, causing errors in socket processing
- fixed & redesigned logging 

RELEASE bgpd.pl-0.03 released on June 21th 2001

beta4: 
- get rid of logging.pm, have logging functions in BGP and Neighbor modules

beta3:
- create BGP::Neighbor module, there is now a BGP::Neighbor object
- create BGP module, there is now a BGP object
- made PathAttribute module, there is now a PathAttribute object

beta2: 
- oob'd %conf (although it is not an object yet),
  two new elements:$conf{adjRIBin} & $conf{localRIB}
- added configuration file support. Neighbors need to be defined in this file
  otherwise incoming BGP sessions are not accepted.
- the routing table dump is now generated after a USR1 signal vs the HUP signal
- an overview of the configured BGP sessions can be generated with SIGUSR2
- fixed a bug where route aggregation was going a bit too automagically :-)

beta1:
- prefixes in adj-RIB-in now reference a Path Attribute hash. This
  hash is referenced by multiple prefixes if these prefixes are send in one
  BGP UPDATE message. This should significantly reduce memory consumption.

RELEASE bgpd.pl-0.02 releases on May 2nd 2001

- fixed LOCAL_PREF handling for BGP UPDATE messages 
  (bug report by Matthias Cramer <cramer@dolphins.ch>)
