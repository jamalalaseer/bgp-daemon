bgpd.pl takes one command-line parameter related to logging:
  --log [0|syslog|file|stdout]		
When `0' is specified for logging or logging is not specified then only
error & warning messages are logged (to syslog). If logging is sent to
STDOUT then bgpd.pl does not become a daemon.

In the bgpd.conf file extensive logging options are available. There are
a number of logging classes. For each of the classes you can set a threshold
level. If the priority of a logging message is lower or equal to the
threshold level then the message is logged. The format is:
  log <class> <level>

The following logging classes are defined: "general", "header", "localRIB",
"open", "update", "notification", "keepalive", "route-refresh" and "list"

Each class has the followig default levels:
"critical", "warning", "info", "parse", "session-errors", "session-warnings"

Some logging classes have specific logging levels:
  class "open":         "parse-open", "parse-open-optional"
  class "update":       "parse-update", "parse-update-prefix",
                        "parse-update-path-attributes"
  class "notification": "parse-notification"
  class "refresh":      "parse-refresh"
  class "header":       "parse-session"
  class "localrib":     "localrib-changes", "localrib-changes-routes",
                        "localrib-changes-eval"

Both class & level strings are case-insensitive. See the bgpd.conf.sample file
for an example.

For bgpd.pl developers:
All messages should be logged with the log methods available from the BGP
and BGP::Neighbor modules. They accept the following parameters:
- type: To what kind of BGP message is the log message related
- priority: Priority of the message
- (array of) message string
Please look at the BGP::Constants.pm packages to see which constants have been
defined to aid the logging of messages.
